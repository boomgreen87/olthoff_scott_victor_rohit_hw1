			<h2>Scott Olthoff</h2>ÃŸ
			<p>
				I am Scott Olthoff and I am team member number 1. I am taking Interactive Media Design so I can take the Visual Effects and Editing for Contemporary Media program and hopefully get into the special effects and video editing industry. I was taking the Computer Programming course but dropped out of that because I was not happy. I took a year off and worked full-time and now I am here in this program.

				In my spare time, I enjoy watching videos, TV shows, and movies, playing video games, playing hockey, and thrift shopping.

				I also run a small business on Instagram called Thrifty Bizness where I sell vintage and thrifted items.
